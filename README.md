1. Thermal profile calculation of an asphalt concrete slab
  - Use a simplified model developed by ???
  - First program integration developed in Excel by Qingwen
  - Some issues regarding shift-factor calculation, stress calculation and interconversion process
2. Correction of errors for shift-factor and interconversion calculation
3. Implementation of  a new stress calculation scheme taking into account material viscoelasticity through the use of:
  - Pseudo-Variables on hereditary integrals
  - Finite Difference approximation of local ODEs
