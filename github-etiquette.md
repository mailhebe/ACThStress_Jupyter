# A few GitHub rules:

- Keep file paths short and sensible.
- Don’t use funky characters ("\_" and "\-" accepted) and spaces in your file names, these cause trouble because of differences in Mac/Windows/Linux systems.
- Always **pull before you start working** on your project *and* **before you push** in case someone has done any work since the last time you pulled - you wouldn’t want anyone’s work to get lost or to have to resolve many coding conflicts.
